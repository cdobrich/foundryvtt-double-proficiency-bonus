# Double Proficiency Bonus

This script will modify how skill rolls are calculated by intercepting the roll process and applying the additional proficiency bonus.

After installing, when you roll a skill check in Foundry VTT, your character's proficiency bonus will be added twice to the roll if they are proficient in that skill.

# Install and Activate the Module

1. Place the double-proficiency-bonus directory into the modules directory of your Foundry VTT installation.
2. Start Foundry VTT, go to the Manage Modules settings, and activate your "Double Proficiency Bonus" module.
